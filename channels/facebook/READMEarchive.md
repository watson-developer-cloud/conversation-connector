# Deploying a Facebook Messenger app

Deploying your workspace to a Facebook Messenger app requires modifying several configuration files and running scripts.

**Note:** This process is intended to connect an existing Watson Conversation workspace to a Facebook app. If you have not yet built a workspace, you must do so first. For more information, see the [Conversation documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/index.html#about).

**Note:** The manual deployment process is supported only on Linux/UNIX and macOS systems.

1.  Clone or download this GitHub repository to your local file system.

1.  If you have not done so already, install the following prerequisite software:

    - The IBM [Cloud Functions CLI](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli)
    - The [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org/), including the npm package manager

1.  Log in using the following command:

    `bx login`

    Select the IBM Cloud organization where you want to deploy.

    **Note:** Currently, only the US South region is supported.

1.  Target the space where you want to deploy by running the following command:

    `bx target --cf`

1.  Go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli and then do the following:

    1.  Click the account information in the upper right corner, and confirm that the organization and space shown are correct.

    1.  Copy the command in step 3 ("Log in to IBM Cloud"), and run it in your CLI.

1.  Go to [https://developers.facebook.com/apps/](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). Log in with your Facebook credentials if necessary.

1.  Click **Add a New App**. Specify a display name for your app and your contact email address, and then click **Create App ID**.

    **Note:** If you have already created the app you want to use, select it from the **My Apps** menu.

1.  In the navigation pane, click **Settings -> Basic**.

1.  Click **Show** and then copy the displayed app secret to the clipboard.

1.  In the root directory of your local copy of the repository, edit the `providers.json` file.  Paste the app secret value into the `app_secret` field of the `facebook` object.

1.  In the Facebook app page, go to the bottom of the navigation pane and click the plus sign (**`+`**) next to **PRODUCTS**.

1. Under **Add a Product**, go to the **Messenger** tile and click **Set Up**.

1.  In the Messenger settings, scroll down to **Token Generation**. Click **Select a Page** and choose the Facebook page you want to use for your app.

    **Note:** If you don't already have a page for your app, click **Create a new page**. After you finish creating the page, return to the [Facebook apps page](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) and navigate back to the Messenger settings for your app. You can then select the page you created.

1.  Copy the page access token. In `providers.json`, paste the value into the corresponding field of the `facebook` object.

1.  In `providers.json`, add a value for `verfication_token`. This can be any string you want to use as a verification token. Make a record of this value, which you will need later. (Facebook will use this verification token to verify your webhook URL.)

1.  In `providers.json`, make sure the channel `name` is set to `facebook`.

1.  In `providers.json`, edit the pipeline `name` to specify a name for your deployment. This name will help you find your Cloud Functions assets later. Only alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9) are kept.

1.  In `providers.json`, edit the `conversation` object to specify the username, password, and workspace ID of the workspace you are deploying.

1.  Run `npm install`.

1.  `cd` to the root of the repository and run `./setup.sh -s`. This creates the Facebook Cloud Functions package, as well as all the other packages in your namespace.

1.  Copy the generated request URL. You can copy this directly from the terminal window after the script completes (look for a message that begins `Your Request URL is:`). If you need to find the endpoint URL later, follow these steps:

    1.  Go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/actions.

    1.  In the list of actions, click on <pipeline_name>_facebook/receive>.

    1.  In the left-hand pane, click **Endpoints**.

    1.  Confirm that **Enable as Web Action** is selected. Copy the provided URL to the clipboard. **Note**: You will need to replace `.json` with `.text` when you paste this value into the Facebook webhook settings.

1.  In the Facebook app settings, go to the Messenger settings and scroll to the **Webhooks** section. Click **Setup Webhooks**.

1.  In the **New Page Subscription** window, paste the request URL from the clipboard into the **Callback URL** field. (If the URL you pasted ends with `.json`, change this to `.text`.) In the **Verify Token** field, specify the same Facebook verification token that you created earlier. Under **Subscription Fields**, select **messages** and **messaging_postbacks**. Then click **Verify and Save**.

1.  After the verification finishes, go back to the **Webhooks** section in the Messenger settings and click **Select a Page**. Select the same page you selected during token generation, and then click **Subscribe**.

    **Note:** Subscribe to only one page. Multiple-page subscriptions are not currently supported.

That's it. You're all set. You can now go to Facebook Messenger, search for your Facebook bot (or the Facebook page you subscribed to), and talk to it!
